# Data Policy Template

This template outlines how your AI Receptionist handles personal data in compliance with GDPR and Norwegian law.

## Purpose of Data Processing

Explain that personal data (name, phone number, email, messages) is collected solely to provide customer service, appointment booking, and invoicing.

## Data Categories Collected

- **Contact information:** Name, phone number, and email address.
- **Appointment details:** Date, time, service requested, and any notes provided.
- **Conversation content:** Messages exchanged between the user and the AI receptionist.

## Legal Basis

State your legal basis for processing personal data, such as legitimate interest and contract (Articles 6(1)(b) and 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).

## Retention Period

Session data is retained for **30 days** by default to assist with follow‑up inquiries and improve service quality. You can modify the retention period in your implementation to meet your internal policies or legal requirements.

Describe how data is stored securely (e.g., encrypted at rest, transport via HTTPS). Note that the PrivacyMiddleware redacts phone numbers and email addresses from logged data to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information.

## Third‑Party Services

List any integrated services (Google Calendar, Gmail, Tripletex, Vipps) and clarify that these providers process data according to their own terms and privacy policies.

## Rights of the Data Subject

Inform individuals of their rights under the GDPR, including the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of their data. Provide instructions on how to submit such requests.

## Contact Information
